# Virtual Edge Node

## Overview

The Virtual Edge Node (VEN) is designed to streamline the onboarding and provisioning of virtual machines, as well as
the deployment, management, and testing of edge computing applications. It offers a virtualized platform that replicates
the functionality of physical edge devices, enabling developers and testers to simulate real-world scenarios without
requiring actual hardware.

**Note: This repository is intended for Edge Developers testing environments and is not meant for production
usecase or deployment on live systems.**

The repository supports Day 0 provisioning of the Virtual Edge Nodes for the Edge Manageability Framework and includes:

- [**VM-Provisioning**](vm-provisioning/): provides a set of scripts, templates, and configurations designed to streamline
  and automate the initial setup and deployment of virtual machines (VMs) during the Day 0 provisioning phase on an Edge
  Orchestrator. It utilizes Vagrant and libvirt APIs to ensure efficient and smooth VM provisioning.
